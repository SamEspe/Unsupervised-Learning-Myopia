# Unsupervised Machine Learning: Myopia

## Contributor: Sam Espe

### Overview
This project was done as a submission for Homework #20 in Data Visualization and Analysis Boot Camp. The goal of the project was to use unsupervised machine learning algorithms to see if the data set could be clustered and if so, how many clusters could be identified. In this project, I used SciKit-Learn in a Jupyter Notebook to perform k-means clustering on a provided data set of 618 children with various parameter measurements. I used both PCA and t-SNE techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the data set so it could be easily graphed.

### Findings
The elbow graph I generated suggested that there were either 3 or 4 clusters within the data set. I performed the k-means clustering for both 3 and 4 clusters, and found that 4 clusters fits the graph of the data better, at least in my opinion. The clusters aren't very distinct or clear, so it is difficult to say if clustering the data truly adds value to the process of identifying myopic children.
